# Cottontail Framework #


### Installation

Assuming we have Git and Rust installed and can run `cargo` commands in the commandline we can install the `ct_makeproject` tool using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/kerskuchen/cottontail.git
cargo install --path cottontail/ct_makeproject
```

Now we can use the `ct_makeproject` tool to create new Cottontail projects via

```
ct_makeproject <PROJECT_NAME> [PROJECT_GIT_URL]

```
